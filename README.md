All rights reserved. Reuse, redistribution, or adaptation of these materials outside this course is not permitted without explicit permission.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a widely used online platform for storing, sharing, and tracking changes to code and documents.  
In this course, GitHub is used **only** to distribute R-related materials for you to view. 

## What You Will Find in This Repository

### `README.md`
This file. 
A README.md file is customarily written by the authors/owner of GitHub repos. 
README.md files provide a standard way to communicate with collaborators. 
This README.md file provides a brief explanation of what this GitHub repository contains and how it is used in the course.

### `R_basics.qmd`
A Quarto source file containing the R code and explanations used in the lessons.
This file is written in plain text and can be read directly on GitHub or opened and run locally on your computer.
Video 1 and Video 2 in Canvas will cover this file in more detail.

### `index.qmd` and `_quarto.yml`
These files define and provide structure to the Quarto website for this repository.
The website is intended for students to view materials in a clean web format, starting with the **R Basics** lesson.

## Important Notes
- You will not run code through this GitHub repository  
- This repository is provided as **read-only reference material**
- You cannot add, modify, or delete content here
- The R lessons can be downloaded and run from within **Canvas**

## GitHub Pages
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to publish the Quarto website with [GitHub Pages](https://uw-heor-data-science-certificate-510.github.io/R_Materials/) when changes are pushed to `main`.

The purpose of this repository is to give you exposure to what a GitHub repository looks like and how code-based course materials are commonly shared.

## We hope you enjoy this abbreviated example of a GitHub repository.
