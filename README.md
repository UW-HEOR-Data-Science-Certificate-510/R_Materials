# Welcome to the R Materials for UW_HEOR_Data_Science_Certificate_510
This is a private GitHub repository containing R learning materials for this course.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a widely used, online system for sharing code and documents, and in this course it is used only to distribute R materials for you to download and run on your own computer.
You will not submit work here. This repository is provided as read-only reference material.

## In this repository you will find the following files:
1.	Two videos that walk through the basics of getting started with R.
2.	R_basics.qmd
The Quarto source file containing the R code used in the lessons.
3.	R_basics.html
A rendered HTML version of the Quarto file for reference.
4.	Auxiliary formatting files used when rendering the Quarto document:
o	uw-pdf-header-tex
o	uw-theme.css
These auxiliary files are automatically used when rendering R_basics.qmd.
Please do not modify any files in this repository.
If you would like to experiment or make changes, download copies to your own machine first.

## Instructions
### 1. Create a local folder
On your own machine, create a folder where you will store the lesson files.

### 2. Download the following files from this repository
Download these files into your local folder:
•	R_basics.qmd
•	uw-pdf-header-tex
•	uw-theme.css
(You do not need to download the HTML unless you want it for reference.)

### 3. Work through the lessons
Start the videos. You may proceed through the R lessons in any one of the following ways:
•	Option A
Follow along with the video without running code.
•	Option B
Create an .Rproj in your local folder, open R_basics.qmd in RStudio, run the code, and render your own R_basics.html.
•	Option C
Create a new (de novo) .qmd file, copy and paste code from R_basics.qmd into it, run the code, and render your own HTML file.

Choose whichever approach best supports your learning.

### 4. Privacy and access
This work is designed to be completed independently:
•	Other students cannot see your work
•	UW faculty and staff cannot see your local files
•	You cannot add to or delete content from this GitHub repository

## We hope you enjoy the R materials we have prepared and that they provide helpful insights into the course content.

### Best wishes,
Professor Beth, Carlos, and Leana
