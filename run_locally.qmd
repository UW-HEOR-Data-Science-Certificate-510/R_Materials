title: "Run R Basics Locally"
---

Use these steps if you download `R_basics.qmd` from GitHub and want to run it on your own computer.

## 1. Install Required Software

- Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- Install RStudio Desktop: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

## 2. Download the Lesson

You have two options:

- Recommended: Download the full repository from GitHub using **Code > Download ZIP** and unzip it.
- Single-file option: Open `R_basics.qmd`, click **Raw**, then save the file.

The full repository download is recommended because it includes theme and image files used by the document.

## 3. Open in RStudio

1. Open RStudio.
2. Open the folder where you downloaded the files.
3. Open `R_basics.qmd`.

## 4. Run Code

- To run code interactively, execute chunks with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`.
- To render the full document from a terminal:

```bash
quarto render R_basics.qmd --execute
```

- To render from R:

```r
quarto::quarto_render("R_basics.qmd", execute = TRUE)
```

## 5. If Rendering Fails

- Install missing R packages shown in the error messages (for example `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`).
- Confirm Quarto is installed and available in your terminal.
