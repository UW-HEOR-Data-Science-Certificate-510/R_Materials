title: "Run R Basics Locally"
---

Use these steps if you download `R_basics.qmd` from GitHub and want to run it on your own computer.


## 1. Install Required Software

- Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- Install RStudio Desktop: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>


## 2. Download the Lesson

Download the full repository from GitHub using **Code > Download ZIP** and unzip it.


## 3. Open in RStudio

1. Open RStudio.
2. Open the folder where you downloaded the files.
3. Open `R_basics.qmd`.


## 4. Run Code

- To run code interactively, execute chunks with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`.
- To render the full document click the Render button at the top of the R Studio screen.
 - Or, you can render by creating a new chunk and typing this line of code:
```r
quarto::quarto_render("R_basics.qmd", execute = TRUE)
```

## 5. If Rendering Fails

- Install missing R packages shown in the error messages (for example `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`).
- Confirm Quarto is installed by typing into your Console: 
quarto::quarto_version()
- If quarto is installed the version number will appear. 
- If quarto is not installed, install it from the quarto website using the URL provided at the top of this script. Then restart R Studio. 
- Restarting RStudio is important because it refreshes the system PATH.
- Then recheck to make sure quarto is installed.
