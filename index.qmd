title: "Welcome to R Materials"
---

This site provides **read-only reference materials** for students in the certificate program.

These materials are shared so you can:

- Review R concepts and examples from class
- See how code-based course materials are organized in GitHub
- Access course reference content in one place

You will not run code through this site. Course activities and runnable files are distributed through Canvas.

## Start Here

- Use the left sidebar to navigate course resources.
- Start with [R Basics Topics](R_basics.qmd), which covers core setup, objects, and operations for getting started with R.

## Download Option

Students can also download the Quarto lesson file to their own computer from GitHub:

1. Open `R_basics.qmd` in the repository.
2. Click **Raw** and save the file, or use **Code > Download ZIP** to download the full repository.
3. Follow the local run steps in [Run Locally](run_locally.qmd).

## Repository Purpose

This repository is used to distribute R-related materials for viewing. Reuse, redistribution, or adaptation outside this course is not permitted without explicit permission.
