This site provides **read-only reference materials** for students in the certificate program.

These materials are shared so you can:

- Review R concepts and examples from class
- See how code-based course materials are organized in GitHub
- Access course reference content in one place

You will not run code through this site. Course activities and runnable files are distributed through Canvas.
